/**************************
 * This file contains uses the "library" toy_elgamal.php
 * It provides a proof-of-concept implementation of the arithmetics 
 * involved in the privacy-preserving network communication protocol
 * described in the article "Homomorphic Cryptography-based
 * Privacy-Preserving Network Communications", by Christophe Bidan, Antoine 
 * Guellier and Nicolas Prigent.
 *
 * This file contains a main loop that performs a certain number of tests
 * for the "route proposition" and "route initialization" procedures of
 * the protocol.
 * The main goals are to verify the arithmetics and EtGamal homomorphic
 * operations, and to attest that the protocol is correct. As a side goal, 
 * this program measures the time required for route propositions or 
 * initialization.
 *
 * This program does not take in account the communication delays, and
 * do not simulate any notion of networking. It focuses on arithmetics.
 * The threshold homomorphic part of the route initialization procedure
 * is also not represented.
 *
 * The program also provides a way to measure running times of the 
 * KeyGen, Enc, Dec, Mult, PlainMult, ScalarExp and ReRand procedures.
 *
 * This code is neither efficient nor secure, and is not meant to be.
